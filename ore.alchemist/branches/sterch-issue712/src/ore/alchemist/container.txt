Alchemist Container
==================

   >>> import ore.alchemist
   >>> from ore.alchemist.tests.test_container import SimpleContent, MultiKeyContent
   >>> from ore.alchemist.container import AlchemistContainer

   >>> session = ore.alchemist.Session()

We create a container :
   
   >>> c = AlchemistContainer()

And assign a class to the container.
The class must be mapped to a table.

   >>> c.class_name = 'ore.alchemist.tests.test_container.SimpleContent'


WriteContainer
--------------

It is important to note that the name used to assign an item to a container
isn't meaningful. The container is only saving the item in the session and then
flushing it to the database. The assigned id is discarded. After an
object is flushed to the database its id will be based on soley on its
primary key(s).

   >>> c[''] = SimpleContent('a')

The above line has the same effect as this :

   >>> t = SimpleContent('b')

Clean up for the next test :

   >>> import transaction
   >>> transaction.abort()

ReadContainer
-------------

We can ask for the length :

   >>> len(c)
   0

   >>> session.add(SimpleContent())

We can iterate over the keys :

   >>> [key for key in c.keys()]
   ['obj-1']

We can iterate over the items :

   >>> [item.id for key, item in c.items()]
   [1]

We can iterate over the values :

   >>> [item.id for item in c.values()]
   [1]

   >>> session.add(SimpleContent())
   >>> len(c)
   2
   >>> [key for key in c.keys()]
   ['obj-1', 'obj-2']

We can access specific object by key :

   >>> c['obj-1'].id
   1
   >>> c['obj-2'].id
   2

  >>> session.close()
